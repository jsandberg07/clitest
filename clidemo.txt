you want to have
1. commands that bring you to a new function / state / whatever
2. flags that you can add to like change the date or whatever
3. how to print all the flags and what they do and how to use them
4. tests for it all
5. ways to cancel stuff

do it like the regular command line
detect when things are - then set those flags to be distinct

this mostly works
create a configuation / memory / setting thing
if you go into sub menus, you want the right map to be displayed
what prints on the cli can be set in the cfg 
set the state and the map so youre not always carrying around a map
and then help doesn't have to load in the same map TWICE to print stuff
cause it'll have access to it
and then help just really iterates
