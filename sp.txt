scratch pad
i have spent an hour and a half deciding what to do kek
better than spending an hour and a half just making mistakes

reminders
- id 
- date 
- investigator (id) 
- cage card (id) 
- note
- reminder state
- add, delete commands (screw edit, too hard to get from db)
- dont delete them, but clean them up when starting the cli like older than a week (eventually)
- maybe also do "hey here's whats coming up tomorrow" too
- delete can be like "here are all the ones for that day, enter a number to delete it" and then use the index
- not the same but who cares it will literally never be used
- if a cage card is deactivated, delete the reminder, alert user

orders
- id
- number / confirmation (also unique)
- date 
- check SEPARATE from reminders and be like "expected orders"
- strain
- vendor (fuhgetabahtit)
- note
- investigator 
- need an orders state
- need a create edit recieve orders commands
- recieve would prompt for cage card #s for a range
- then add and activate in the db with the note, investigator, that date
- order number added to ccs
- query for a particular order too

queries 
- get "all" reminders, for a date range, or for a particular investigator
- get all orders or for an investigator


processings ccs
go routine with a channel listening for cc's
enter a number, it gets params added, put into a channel, processed
print message or print error
better for memory, just as fast
add an undo or "pop"
adding reminder like E17 or whatever

add query for getting cage cards by a number range
do rough reminders that still have like the ids and whatever
then one that is formatted with name and joins and ect cause you can't think apparently

finish adding orders
add an optional order number column to cage cards
update all cage card functions to return an order number if necessary
get cage cards by order number
test these things
then check your main for stuff to do
it's wendesday morning, 2 days into your vacation and you jsut finished 2 boot dev courses kek
i think you can finish this. after brunch tho.
