scratch pad
i have spent an hour and a half deciding what to do kek
better than spending an hour and a half just making mistakes

reminders
- id 
- date 
- investigator (id) 
- cage card (id) 
- note
- reminder state
- add, delete commands (screw edit, too hard to get from db)
- dont delete them, but clean them up when starting the cli like older than a week (eventually)

orders
- id
- number / confirmation (also unique)
- date 
- check SEPARATE from reminders and be like "expected orders"
- strain
- vendor (fuhgetabahtit)
- note
- investigator 
- need an orders state
- need a create edit recieve orders commands
- recieve would prompt for cage card #s for a range
- then add and activate in the db with the note, investigator, that date
- order number added to ccs
- query for a particular order too

queries 
- get "all" reminders, for a date range, or for a particular investigator
- get all orders or for an investigator


processings ccs
go routine with a channel listening for cc's
enter a number, it gets params added, put into a channel, processed
print message or print error
better for memory, just as fast
add an undo or "pop"
adding reminder like E17 or whatever

add query for getting cage cards by a number range
do rough reminders that still have like the ids and whatever
then one that is formatted with name and joins and ect cause you can't think apparently
