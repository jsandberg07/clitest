Things I would like to add:
* deleting reminders after x days (and an option for it)
* implementing the single current setting that can be changed (anybody can activate anybodys cards or add orders)
* better instruction printing
* explicit instructions to use "_" instead of spaces
* more queries for all types investigators, strains, positions even 
* add notes to CC queries 
* better names for export files
* spinning up a temp db for testing (https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2024-11-19-testing-with-go-and-postgresql-ephemeral-dbs/)
* PI restriction / permission
* Printing time to just be a date (as theyre always ad midnight) 
* Printing things when new params are set 
* * (setFunc(type string, s interface{}) {print("x is set - values)})
* more test data
*  server version (yay json)
